                <h1>Automotive</h1>
            </div>
            <div id="auto">
                <p>Despite some rough years, the automotive industry is still one of the most important economic sectors. Car manufacturers are continuously trying to put the current technologies to use in order to deliver the best vehicles.<br>Typically, when you start exploring the market for a new car, you need to visit a dealership. They usually display a few models and often don’t even have the color you’re looking for. Now imagine a VR environment. Within it, you’re able to customize any make or model in exactly the way you’re going to buy it. You’ll be able to walk around it and step into the driver seat. With the development of quality VR headsets, this technology can be brought to any showroom, and it needn’t cost a fortune, either!<br>The great thing about VR is that it allows you to show your consumers the future. It makes perfect sense for automotive marketing, as consumers often buy cars built to their own specs months before they actually roll off the assembly line.<br>With a virtual reality showroom, vendors can demonstrate how a paint job will look on someone’s dream car, or how a set of bigger alloys will fit the new look.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Probably the biggest technological milestone in the automotive industry is currently the self-driving car.Testing software that controls the vehicle can be aided by VR technology. Obviously, the car doesn’t wear a VR headset and doesn’t have to be driven around town for testing. Instead, its sensors are replaced by data streams simulated in VR. Think of it as VR car driving brought to the next level.<br>Corner cases in testing a vehicle tend to be dangerous or costly. Is a laden truck able to avoid a pedestrian? How does the car respond if it’s hit at full speed by another vehicle? It’s easy to see that doing the same test in a VR auto simulator removes any risk of injuring people or damaging expensive resources.<br>Tests should be repeatable. From a software development perspective, this is obvious and, in many domains, fairly straightforward. In the physical world, it’s much less so. Want to know how a car responds under a certain set of weather conditions? Or on roads that are not available near the R&D site? Recreating specific physical conditions is hard and expensive, whereas in VR it’s a relatively simple matter of configuring the virtual world.</p>
                <br>
                <p>On top of technical safety aspects of a self-driving car, there is always the human factor to take into account. Think of an occupant as a user of the car and it’s immediately clear that the User Experience (UX) is incredibly important. You don’t want the car to intimidate or frustrate users. Instead, it should be a pleasant ride. Determining how to achieve that is far from trivial. Again, researching all kinds of conditions with real-world cars would be tremendously expensive. In VR, it’s much easier, faster, and cheaper to study these aspects. Running an A/B test doesn’t require the production of two physical models, but only takes two virtual models.<br>Until cars are entirely autonomous, there is a complex transition of control between human and car. Officially, the human driver is always supposed to pay attention, even in autopilot mode. However, in reality, the ‘driver’ might be reading a newspaper, having a snack, or even taking a nap. In VR, research can be done safely on how to design this crucial interaction between car and driver.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Unfortunately, accidents do happen. When they do, it can be difficult to establish exactly what happened. For insurance companies and law enforcement, it’s important to reconstruct how and why an accident occurred. After hypothesizing how an accident may have happened, the events can be simulated in a VR environment. Eyewitness reports from victims and bystanders can then be matched against the line-of-sight models in VR. This can serve as verification for eyewitness reports.<br>Government agencies can use the reconstructions to study road safety. In the future this may allow for better decision-making. A city planner could analyze traffic incidents to determine if different design choices would reduce the risk of accidents on a certain stretch of road. They can also use VR to optimize the look and feel of infrastructure design. For example, when a new bridge or tunnel is proposed, a 3D model in VR can provide a much more realistic sense of it. It’s easy to see that a similar approach could be used to aid the design of other automotive infrastructure, from highways to driveways.</p>
