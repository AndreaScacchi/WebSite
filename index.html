                <h1>VIRTUAL REALITY</h1>
            </div>
            <div id="explain">
                <p><strong>Virtual Reality</strong> or <strong>VR</strong> represents an extraordinary shift in the way humans experience the digital realm.<br>The current life cycle of virtual reality may have begun when the earliest prototypes of the Oculus Rift showed up at the E3 videogame trade show in 2012, but it's been licking at the edges of our collective consciousness for more than a century.<br>In 2012, id Software cofounder and virtual-reality aficionado, John Carmack, came to the E3 videogame trade show with a special surprise: He had borrowed a prototype of a headset created by a 19-year-old VR enthusiast named Palmer Luckey and hacked it to run a VR version of the game Doom. Its face was covered with duct tape, and a strap ripped from a pair of Oakley ski goggles was all that held it to your head, but it worked. When people out on the headset, they found themselves surrounded by the 3D graphics they'd normally see on a tv or monitor. They weren't just playing Doom, they were inside it.<br>Things happened fast after that. Luckey's company, Oculus, raised more than $2 million on Kickstarter to produce the headset, which he called the Oculus Rift. In 2014, Facebook purchased Oculus for nearly $3 billion. ("Oculus has the chance to create the most social platform ever, and change the way we work, play and communicate," Mark Zuckerberg said at the time.)<br>In 2016, the first wave of dedicated consumer VR headsets arrived, though all three were effectively peripherals rather than full systems: The Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive each connected to high-powered PCs, and the PlayStation VR system ran off a PlayStation 4 game console. In 2018, the first "stand-alone" headsets hit the market. They don't connect to a computer or depend on your smartphone to supply the display and processing; they're self-contained, all-in-one devices that make VR truly easy to use for the first time ever.</p>
                <br>
                <p>But even with that sort of device, we're at the beginning of a long, uncertain roadâ€”not because of what the technology can do, but because of how people could misuse it. The internet is great; how people treat each other on the internet, not so much. Apply that logic to VR, where being embodied as an avatar means you have personal boundaries that can be violated, and where spatialized audio and haptic feedback lets you hear and feel what other people are saying and doing to you, and you're looking at a potential for harassment and toxic behavior that's exponentially more visceral and traumatizing than anything on conventional social media.</p>
                <br>
                <p>To conclude, this is an exciting time for VR to improve and growth through the tech market. Virtual Reality will be the future of many firms!</p>
