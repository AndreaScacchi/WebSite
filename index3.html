                <p>We’ve seen a huge increase in the use of VR in the healthcare sector and continue to be fascinated & impressed by the different applications our clients are requesting. From developing new life-saving techniques to training the doctors of the future, VR has a multitude of applications for health and healthcare, from the clinical to the consumer. And by 2020, the global market could be worth upwards of $3.8 billion.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Virtual Reality has the ability to transport you inside the human body – to access & view areas that otherwise would be impossible to reach.<br>The ability to view the inside of the human body in Virtual Reality is not only useful for doctors, but also for patients. VR allows patients to be taken through their surgical plan by virtually stepping into a patient-specific 360° VR reconstruction of their anatomy & pathology. The result – enhanced understanding of the treatment, and consequently higher patient satisfaction.</p>
                <br>
                <p>VR’s unique ability to transport you somewhere else can be used to create powerful simulations of the scenarios in which psychological difficulties occur. No longer does a therapist need to accompany a client on a trip to a crowded shopping centre, for example, or up a tall building. Situations that are impractical or impossible to recreate — flying, for example, or the harrowing events that can lie behind PTSD — can be conjured at the click of a mouse. The in-situ coaching that’s so effective for so many disorders can now be delivered in the consulting room, with the simulations graded in difficulty and repeated as often as necessary. VR has also been used to curb memory loss, help autistic children in the classroom and gather data for dementia research.</p>
                <br>
                <p>VR’s healing capabilities aren’t just limited to psychological issues, but have been proved to work for pain management & physical treatment too. A study by the University of Washington Seattle and the UW Harborview Burn Centre showed that full VR immersion for those undergoing physical therapy after a skin graft acted as a distraction and subsequently reduced pain levels for the patients. VR for physical therapy has also been shown to be effective in speeding up recovery time. Allowing the patient to do their prescribed daily exercises in a virtual environment makes the activity more fun, keeps the patient focused, and helps them keep their spirits up during what can be a long recovery period.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Pharmaceutical research & development company AbbVie created an experience to raise awareness amongst healthcare professionals of the daily struggle of patients suffering from Parkinsons disease. The experience was demo-ed at a pharmaceutical industry trade show where people could put on a headset and experience first hand as a Parkinsons sufferer navigates a virtual supermarket, encountering awkward moments when coming into contact with other people.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In the coming years, VR will be used more and more to improve the accuracy & effectiveness of current procedures, and enhance the capabilities of the human being, both as the care-giver and the patient. Quite simply, the potential for VR in the healthcare sector is huge, limited only by the creativity & ingenuity of those creating and applying the technology.</p>
